The project requires Python 3.5+ with the numpy and matplotlib modules.

The file demo.py demonstrates basic use of the algorithm. Results can be manipulated by editing the parameters object, and defining new functions that generate trainingfrom the parameters and group structure.

Files named result_{x}.py were used to generate results in this report. The file result_1_2_4.py can be tuned using the parameters at the top of the diagrams above.

The algorithm is implemented in proxregression.py, and testing code is in testing.py.
